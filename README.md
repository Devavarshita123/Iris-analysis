# Iris Analysis ðŸŒ¸

This repository contains a **machine learning project** focused on classifying Iris flower species (*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, *Virginica*) based on sepal and petal measurements. It includes **data exploration, model training, evaluation**, and comparison of multiple classification algorithms.

---

## Project Overview

The **Iris dataset** is a classic benchmark in machine learning. This project aims to:

- Explore the dataset through **visualizations** and **statistical analysis**.
- Develop and evaluate **classification models** for predicting Iris species.
- Provide a **clear, reproducible workflow** for analyzing and modeling the data.
