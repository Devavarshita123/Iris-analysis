# Iris-analysis
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying Iris flower species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements. It includes data exploration, model training, and evaluation using various classification algorithms

## Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a popular benchmark dataset in machine learning and data science. This project aims to:

* Explore the dataset through visualizations and statistical analysis.
* Develop and evaluate machine learning models for species classification.
* Provide a clear and well-documented workflow for analyzing the Iris dataset.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, each with four features:

* Sepal length (cm)
* Sepal width (cm)
* Petal length (cm)
* Petal width (cm)

The target variable is the Iris species, which can be one of three classes:

* Setosa
* Versicolor
* Virginica

## Repository Contents

## Analysis and Models

The iris_analysis.ipynb notebook demonstrates the following steps:

* *Data Loading and Exploration:* Loading the dataset, examining its structure, and visualizing feature distributions.
* *Data Visualization:* Scatter plots, histograms, and pair plots to understand relationships between features and species.
* *Data Preprocessing:* potential scaling, or other preprocessing steps.
* *Model Training:* Training various classification models, such as:
    * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    * Logistic Regression
    * Decision Trees
    * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    * Random Forest.
* *Model Evaluation:* Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* *Model comparison:* Comparing the performance of each model.
